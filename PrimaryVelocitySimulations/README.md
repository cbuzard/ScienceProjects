I wrote this program to test the efficiency of different observational strategies for detecting hot Jupiters. I simulated 5 epoch Keck/NIRSPEC data sets with two variable parameters, (1) the relative Doppler shift between the stellar and telluric spectrum and (2) the relative Doppler shift between the planetary and stellar spectrum. The Gaussian models fit and plotted in this program were used to identify which simulated data sets showed strong and clear planetary signals.
